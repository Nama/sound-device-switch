# Quickly change your default sound device

## Requirements
* Pillow
* [lglcdlib](https://github.com/Nama/lglcdlib)
* Logitech keyboard with monochrome display
  * Remove keyboard-specific code to make it work otherwise

## Configuration
* Set the path to your [nircmd.exe](http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/nircmd.html)
* Type in the names of your sound devices to the ``sound1``, ``sound2``, ... variables

## Info
I made the fourth button to toggle mute for my Switch sound input. You should just change the code for your needs, you have the examples.
